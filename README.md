- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BrandyMcKinney
- ðŸŒ± I am a full-stack bootcamp graduate who is diving deeper in my coding journey and working towards landing my first role as a software              developer!
- ðŸ‘€ Baking is my jam, rollerblading soothes me, good music all day and nothing like a good cup of coffee.
